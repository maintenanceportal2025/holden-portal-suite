🎯 PRIMARY PURPOSE:
Desktop mass email notification system for sending templated emails to residents
across zones. Provides template selection, variable customization, email preview,
and recipient filtering for targeted communications.

🔗 SYSTEM CONNECTIONS:
• Backend API: Email Service (AKfycbwwSy44WvoHQIKiUn9Ctf0rHyYCuLPNFBrlSVSexks7rVnRvdVQeZC9F3Zwu2RruX3v)
• Template System: Same templates as FieldAlerts.html
• Recipient System: Zone-based filtering (same zones as FieldAlerts)
• Integration Status: Standalone desktop tool
• Related Files: FieldAlerts.html, email-communication-hub.html, email-notification-management.html

⚙️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
• Technology: HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript
• Design: Desktop-optimized interface with detailed controls
• Authentication: None (open access for mass communications)
• Dependencies: Email Service backend only
• Browser Support: Modern desktop browsers
• API Protocol: Standard fetch requests (not JSONP like FieldAlerts)

🎨 UI/UX FEATURES:
• Template Grid: Visual template selection with categories
• Variable Inputs: Dynamic form generation for template customization
• Email Preview: Live preview of composed email before sending
• Recipient Info: Real-time recipient count and zone details
• Progress Indicators: Loading states and service status monitoring
• Notification System: Success/error feedback with animations

🔄 WORKFLOW:
1. Select Template: Choose from grid of available email templates
2. Customize Variables: Fill in template-specific variables and data
3. Preview Email: Review composed email content and recipients
4. Select Recipients: Choose zone filtering or recipient groups
5. Send Email: Mass delivery via Email Service backend
6. Confirmation: Real-time delivery status and feedback

🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS: 🚧 DEVELOPMENT
• Current State: Functional desktop prototype for mass communications
• Integration: Standalone (not connected to main system dashboard)
• Production Ready: No - requires consolidation with other notification tools

🔍 ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS:
• Module Category: Mass Communications (Desktop)
• Access Level: Administrative tool (no authentication required)
• Data Source: Email Service Backend (shared with FieldAlerts)
• Unique Features: Desktop interface, template customization, email preview

⚠️ CRITICAL OVERLAP DETECTED:
• DUPLICATE FUNCTIONALITY: FieldAlerts.html provides mobile emergency notifications
• SAME BACKEND: Both use identical Email Service API
• SAME ZONES: Both target same zone system (zone1-zone5, all_units)
• SAME TEMPLATES: Both access same template library
• CONSOLIDATION REQUIRED: Desktop vs Mobile versions of same functionality

🎯 INTEGRATION QUESTIONS:
• Should this be merged with FieldAlerts as responsive design?
• Does template customization justify separate desktop interface?
• Should both tools be integrated into single admin communications module?
• Is zone-based targeting centrally managed across all notification tools?
• How does this relate to email-communication-hub.html functionality?

🚨 DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
• API calls use standard fetch (different from FieldAlerts JSONP approach)
• Template variable system more sophisticated than FieldAlerts
• Recipient filtering appears more advanced than FieldAlerts
• Service status monitoring similar to FieldAlerts implementation
